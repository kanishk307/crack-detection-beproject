# Real Time inspection of Concrete Structures Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning 

A python-based crack detection and classification system using deep learning; used YOLO object detection algorithm. To extract the features of cracks we used Computer Vision and developed a desktop tool using Kivy to display the outcomes.
